 *
 *   * VFS mode works by patching Commodore KERNAL routines at fixed
 *     addresses. On the bundled Open ROMs -- an independent reimplementation
 *     -- those routines are not there, the patch never fires, and the LOAD
 *     goes out to a drive that does not exist: "?DEVICE NOT PRESENT ERROR".
 *   * RAM injection needs no KERNAL at all, but it can only start a program
 *     that RUN will start. A machine-code game that loads outside the BASIC
 *     area sits at the READY prompt doing nothing, which is what happens to
 *     real titles under it.
 *
 * So the caller decides, and it is not a preference: it follows which ROMs
 * are fitted. With Open ROMs the only thing expected to run is the bundled
 * demo, which is a BASIC stub and starts fine either way; with real ROMs the
 * VFS path is the one that has always worked and stays the default.
